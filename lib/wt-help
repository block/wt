  remove [worktree]         Remove a worktree
                            - interactive worktree selection if omitted
                            - use --merged to remove all merged-branch worktrees
  list [-v]                 List all worktrees with status
                            - use -v for dirty/ahead/behind indicators
  cd [worktree]             Change directory to a worktree

                                - src: source repo (default: $WT_MAIN_REPO_ROOT)
                                - vault: metadata vault (default: $WT_IDEA_FILES_BASE)

  metadata-import [vault] [wt]  Import project metadata into a worktree
                                - vault: metadata vault (default: $WT_IDEA_FILES_BASE)
